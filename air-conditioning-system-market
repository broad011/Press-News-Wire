<p>According to the latest report by IMARC Group, titled <strong>"Air Conditioning System Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2020-2025,"</strong> the global air conditioning system market size grew at a CAGR of around 10.6% during 2014-2019. An air conditioning system facilitates the removal of heat and moisture present in an enclosed space to alter the overall temperature. The heat is replaced from the given area with chilled dry air while the hot air and moisture are expelled in the atmosphere. The system restraints the entry of smoke or dust particles and aids in improving the comfort of the dwellers by creating a regulated interior environment. Consisting of fans, compressors, condenser coil, evaporator coil and chemical refrigerants, the suitable thermal condition and superior indoor air quality provided by these systems aid in improving human efficiency and maintaining proper health functions. Consequently, they have emerged as an indispensable component across domestic, commercial and industrial environments.</p>
