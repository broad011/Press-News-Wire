<p><strong>India Online Food Delivery Market Trends:</strong></p>

<p>With increasing digital literacy and enhanced access to high-speed internet facilities, there is an increasing number of people using smartphones in India. This, coupled with rising working population and consumer expenditure capacity, represents one of the key factors catalyzing the growth of the market. In line with this, the emerging trends of the on-the-go foods and quick home delivery models, which offer convenient, ready-to-eat and cheaper food delivery options, are contributing to the market growth significantly. In addition to this, discounts and cashback offers provided by online food ordering apps, such as Zomato and Swiggy, play a crucial role in attracting consumers, particularly the young population. Furthermore, the leading food delivery companies are acquiring or collaborating with popular restaurants and food delivery chains. For instance, Zomato acquired Uber's food delivery business in India in an all-stock deal of nearly $350 Million. Along with this, these delivery portals also offer a wide variety of payment options that ensure a secure and smooth transaction, which contributes to their widespread popularity.
