<strong>Global Aramid Fiber Market Trends:</strong>

Aramid fibers offer low flammability , resistance against heat and organic solvents , and can be made waterproof when combined with other materials like epoxy. Owing to these properties, they are utilized in an array of equipment, ranging from body armor, fire protection clothes and bulletproof vests to vehicle armor, military helmets, protective gloves, and fireproof suits for firefighters. In the construction industry, the demand for aramid fibers has escalated as they are employed in the manufacturing of fiber-reinforced concrete and corrosion-resistant thermoplastic pipes, which help in extending the life of the pipeline and reducing the overall maintenance costs. Other than this, they are used in the production of aerospace components, such as primary wings, fuselage structures in new-generation aircraft, trailing edge panels and landing gear doors. Moreover, the leading manufacturers are engaging in extensive research and development (R&amp;D) activities to produce high-quality aramid fibers at a lower cost. Owing to these factors, the market value is projected to reach US$ 5.7 Billion, exhibiting a CAGR of around 8% during 2020-2025.
