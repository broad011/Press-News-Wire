<strong>Market Trends:</strong>

Owing to its lower cost, excellent flexibility and high chemical resistance, low density polyethylene (LDPE) is used in various end-use industries across the globe. The growing usage of this material in the packaging industry is one of the most significant factors that are bolstering the growth of the market. It is used in the production of floor tiles, shipping envelopes, dropper bottles, tamper-evident, liners, trash bags, and films for food packaging and laminations. Also, LDPE-based compounds are utilized in jacketing and insulating materials for sheathing telecommunication cables as well as wire and cable applications. Besides this, due to its low water absorption and plasticity, low density polyethylene is extensively used in the pipes and fittings industry. Moreover, with rising environmental concerns, the demand for LDPE is increasing as these products are non-toxic and renewable in nature and can be recycled under certain conditions. Looking forward, the market value is projected to reach US$ 43 Billion by 2025, exhibiting a CAGR of nearly 3.8% during 2020-2025.
