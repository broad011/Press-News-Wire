<p><strong> </strong><strong>Global Depression Drugs Market Trends:</strong></p>

<p>The increasing awareness regarding the prevalence of depression and other mental illnesses has led a majority of the population to seek professional help, which is primarily driving the market. Hectic lifestyles, improper dietary habits and long working hours, along with social isolation and stressful work environment, have resulted in the development of stress disorders among the working population, which is another major factor boosting the sales of depression drugs. Moreover, the increasing geriatric population is another major growth-inducing factor. The elderly population is more prone to health disorders, which may be followed by mental illnesses. Also, elderlies are more likely to endure the sense of social isolation, especially from the immediate family members and friends, which consequently leads to depression. Furthermore, manufacturers are continually engaging in research and development (R&amp;D) activities to introduce effective variants with minimal side-effects and prolonged results. On account of the aforementioned factors, the market is anticipated to reach to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% during 2020-2025.</p>
