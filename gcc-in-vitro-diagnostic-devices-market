<strong><a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/gcc-in-vitro-diagnostic-devices-market">GCC In-vitro Diagnostic Devices Market Trends</a>:</strong>

The growing spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the GCC countries has significantly boosted the market growth, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed two IVD tests for emergency use during the pandemic. These tests include the <em>cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay </em>and<em> Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID-19)</em>. Additionally, the rising incidences of chronic diseases and the growing geriatric population are further driving the demand for IVD devices. As per the WHO, about 60% of deaths in the GCC countries are caused due to non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular dysfunction. This has compelled governments of GCC countries to take initiatives to improve the healthcare services in the region. Some of these initiatives are aimed at investing in improved IVD devices, which are more accurate and efficient in executing diagnostic tests. This, along with the expanding insurance coverage under national health insurance programs, such as the Mandatory Health Insurance (MHI) schemes, to provide better and easy access to diagnostic devices, are boosting the sales of IVD devices across the region. Owing to these factors, the market value is projected to reach US$ 1,351 Million by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of 5.6% during 2020-2025.
