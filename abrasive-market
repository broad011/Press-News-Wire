<p><strong>Global Abrasives Market Trends:</strong></p>

<p>The global market is primarily driven by significant growth in the automotive industry. These materials are widely utilized for the manufacturing of various automotive parts, such as mirrors, air ducts and fuel tanks. Additionally, abrasives are crucial for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions and lowering noise levels in automobiles. Rapid urbanization, increasing global population and inflating per capita income levels have provided a boost to the sales of automobiles across the globe, thereby catalyzing the demand for abrasives. Moreover, the demand for these materials for metal fabrication is also providing a thrust to the market growth. Since they are utilized for surface blending as well as for removing welds, the emergence of automation in metal fabrication is expected to provide a stimulus to the market growth. Furthermore, extensive research and development (R&amp;D) have led to the introduction of the next generation of non-woven abrasives in the market. Also, these materials provide minimal smearing issues, enhanced versatility and faster cut-rate, which is further contributing to their widespread preference across industries. On account of the aforementioned factors, the market is expected to reach a value of US$ 59.7 Billion by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of 5.4% during 2020-2025.</p>
